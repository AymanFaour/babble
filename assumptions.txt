- I assumed that delete is in real time, so you don't have to refresh the page in order to see the result of pressing the delete button.
- opening a TAB increment the users in the stats by one, and closing it doesn't decrement it by 1, only exiting the whole browser will 
decrement (each tab is the same person of course), I did that because there is no way distinguishing users who are anonymous so 
I used the simple functons: "onbeforeunload" and "onload" to decrement and increment. if I had a way to differentiate two anonymous 
I would gladly add users util (as in messages util) to manage the users, but sense we are not allowed to add anything to the anonymous 
userInfo fields I was forced to increment and decrement using those simple two functions. so i had to add it in the assumptions.
